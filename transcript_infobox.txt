| Description:    William Henry "Bill" Gates III is an American business magnate, philanthropist, investor, computer   |
|                 programmer, and inventor. Gates is the former chief executive and chairman of Microsoft, the         |
|                 world’s largest personal-computer software company, which he co-founded with Paul Allen. He is     |
|                 consistently ranked in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people and was the wealthiest       |
|                 overall from 1995 to 2009—excluding 2008, when he was ranked third; in 2011 he was the wealthiest  |
|                 American and the world's second wealthiest person. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires List,     |
|                 Gates became the the world's richest person again in 2013, a position that he last held on the list  |
|                 in 2007. As of March 2014, he is the richest. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the         |
|                 positions of CEO and chief software architect, and remains the largest individual shareholder, with  |
|                 6.4 percent of the common stock. He has also authored and co-authored several books. Gates is one of |
|                 the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. Gates has been criticized for his  |
|                 business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases    |
|                 been upheld by judicial courts. In the later stages of his career, Gates has pursued a number of     |
|                 philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and     |
|                 scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, established in 2000.       |

| Description:    Robert John Downey, Jr. is an American actor who made his screen debut at the age of five, appearing |
|                 in his father Robert Downey, Sr.'s film Pound. He has appeared in roles associated with the Brat     |
|                 Pack, such as Less Than Zero and Weird Science. Other films he has starred in include Air America,   |

|                 from the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in 2000 for drug charges,    |
|                 Downey joined the cast of the TV series Ally McBeal playing Calista Flockhart's love interest. His   |

|                 The Singing Detective, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly, Gothika, Zodiac and Tropic Thunder, for|

| Description:    Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American recording artist, dancer, |
|                 singer-songwriter, musician, and philanthropist. Referred to as the King of Pop, Jackson is          |
|                 recognized as the most successful entertainer of all time by Guinness World Records. His contribution|
|                 to music, dance, and fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a global figure in|
|                 popular culture for over four decades. The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the    |
|                 professional music scene along with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5, then the Jacksons in  |
|                 1964, and began his solo career in 1971. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in     |
|                 popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and      |
|                 "Thriller", were credited with transforming the medium into an art form and a promotional tool, and  |
|                 the popularity of these videos helped to bring the relatively new television channel MTV to fame And |

| Description:      The National Football League is a professional American football league that constitutes one of the|
|                   four major professional sports leagues in North America. It is composed of 32 teams divided equally|
|                   between the National Football Conference and the American Football Conference. The highest         |
|                   professional level of the sport in the world, the NFL runs a 17-week regular season from the week  |
|                   after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing sixteen games and having one   |
|                   bye week each season. Out of the league's 32 teams, six from each conference compete in the NFL    |
|                   playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the        |
|                   champions of the NFC and AFC. The champions of the Super Bowl are awarded the Vince Lombardi       |
|                   Trophy. Various other awards exist to recognize individual players and coaches. Most games are     |
|                   played on Sunday afternoons; some games are also played on Mondays and Thursdays during the regular|
|                   season. There are games on Saturdays during the first two playoff weekends. Sometimes, there are   |
|                   also Saturday games during the last few weeks of the regular season. The NFL was formed on August  |
|                   20, 1920, as the American Professional Football Conference; the league changed its name to the     |
|                   American Professional Football Association on September 17, 1920, and changed its name to the      |
|                   National Football League on June 24, 1922, after spending the 1920 and 1921 seasons as the APFA. In|
|                   1966, the NFL agreed to merge with the rival American Football League, effective 1970; the first   |
|                   Super Bowl was held at the end of that same season in January 1967. Today, the NFL has the highest |
|                   average attendance of any professional sports league in the world and is the most popular sports   |
|                   league in the United States. The Super Bowl is among the biggest club sporting events in the world |
|                   and individual Super Bowl games account for many of the most-watched television programs in        |
|                   American history. At the corporate level, the NFL is a nonprofit 501 association. The NFL's        |
|                   executive officer is the commissioner, who has broad authority in governing the league.            |

| Description:   The New York Knickerbockers, commonly referred to as the Knicks, are a professional basketball team   |
|                based in New York City, New York. The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding |
|                members of the Basketball Association of America, which became the NBA after merging with rival       |
|                National Basketball League in 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Garden in the borough of         |
|                Manhattan and is one of only two teams of the original National Basketball Association still located  |
|                in its original city. The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff   |
|                contenders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made    |
|                three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned  |
|                in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter. It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman   |
|                became head coach did the Knicks begin to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided  |
|                the Knicks to two championship titles in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that|
|                included six playoff appearances however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.               |

| Description:   The Miami Heat are a professional basketball team based in Miami, Florida, United States. The team is |
|                a member of the Southeast Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association.  |
|                They play their home games at the American Airlines Arena in Downtown Miami. The team owner is Micky  |
|                Arison, who also owns cruise-ship giant Carnival Corporation. The team president and de facto general |
|                manager is Pat Riley, and the head coach is Erik Spoelstra. The mascot of the team is Burnie, an      |
|                anthropomorphic fireball. Formed in 1988 as one of the NBA's four expansion franchises, the Heat have |
|                won three league championships, five conference titles and 11 division titles. From February 3 to     |

|                paid tribute to the older franchise by wearing a replica version of the Floridians' uniforms for the  |
|                NBA's "Hardwood Classics Nights" during the 2005–06 and 2011–12 seasons.                          |
